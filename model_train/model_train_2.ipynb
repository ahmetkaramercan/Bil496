At that point , you may experience these symptoms : Severe , sharp pain in the side and back , below the ribs Pain that radiates to the lower abdomen and groin Pain that comes in waves and fluctuates in intensity Pain or burning sensation while urinating Other signs and symptoms may include : Pink , red or brown urine Cloudy or foul-smelling urine A persistent need to urinate , urinating more often than usual or urinating in small amounts Nausea and vomiting Fever and chills if an infection is present Pain caused by a kidney stone may change — for instance , shifting to a different location or increasing in intensity — as the stone moves through your urinary tract .',\n",

Some infants need to spend time in a unit that cares for them and closely tracks their health day and night . This is called a neonatal intensive care unit ( NICU ) . A step down from the NICU is an intermediate care nursery , which provides less intensive care . Special nursery units are staffed with health care providers and a team that 's trained to help preterm babies . NICU Your baby may need extra help feeding and adapting right after delivery . Your health care team can help you understand what 's needed and what your baby 's care plan will be . Feel free to ask them questions .\",\n",

       "  \"foretoken and symptom will vary , depending on the severity of the injury , and may include : Pain or tenderness Redness or bruising Limited motion Muscle spasms Swelling Muscle weakness When to see the doctor Mild strains can be treated at home . See a doctor if your symptoms worsen despite treatment — especially if your pain becomes intolerable , or you experience numbness or tingling . Causes Acute strains can be caused by one event , such as using poor body mechanics to lift something heavy . Chronic muscle strains can result from repetitive injuries when you stress a muscle by doing the same motion over and over . Risk factors Participating in contact sports — such as soccer , football , hockey , boxing and wrestling — can increase your risk of muscle strains . Certain parts of the body are more susceptible to strains during participation in certain sports . Examples include : Legs and ankles . Sports that feature quick starts and jumping , such as hurdling and basketball , can be particularly tough on the Achilles tendon in your ankle . Hands . Gripping sports , such as gymnastics or golf , can increase your risk of muscle strains in your hands . Elbows . Elbow strains are often caused by throwing sports and racquet sports . Prevention Regular stretching and strengthening exercises for your sport , fitness or work activity , as part of an overall physical conditioning program , can help to minimize your risk of muscle strains . Try to be in shape to play your sport ; do n't play your sport to get in shape . If you have a physically demanding occupation , regular conditioning can help prevent injuries .

       "  \"planetary_house and symptom will vary , depending on the severity of the greenstick fracture . Mild fractures might be mistaken for sprains or bruises . More-severe greenstick fractures may cause an obvious deformity , accompanied by significant pain and swelling . When to see a doctor Contact your doctor if your child has persistent pain in an injured limb . Seek immediate medical attention if a child is unable to bear weight or if there is obvious pain , deformity and swelling . Causes Childhood fractures most commonly occur with a fall . Arm fractures are more common than leg fractures , since the common reaction is to throw out your arms to catch yourself when you fall . Risk factors The risk of greenstick fractures is higher in young children because their bones are softer and more flexible than adult bones . In a greenstick fracture , the bone bends and cracks instead of breaking into separate pieces . Most greenstick fractures occur in children under age 10 .

       "  'planetary_house and symptom of trachoma usually affect both eyes and may include : Mild itching and irritation of the eyes and eyelids Eye discharge containing mucus or pus Eyelid swelling Light sensitivity ( photophobia ) Eye pain Eye redness Vision loss Young children are particularly susceptible to infection . But the disease progresses slowly , and the more painful symptoms may not emerge until adulthood . The World Health Organization ( WHO ) has identified five stages in the development of trachoma : Inflammation — follicular . The early infection has five or more follicles — small bumps that contain lymphocytes , a type of white blood cell — visible with magnification on the inner surface of your upper eyelid ( conjunctiva ) . Inflammation — intense . In this stage , your eye is now highly infectious and becomes irritated , with a thickening or swelling of the upper eyelid . Eyelid scarring . Repeated infections lead to scarring of the inner eyelid . The scars often appear as white lines when examined with magnification . Your eyelid may become distorted and may turn in ( entropion ) . In-turned eyelashes ( trichiasis ) . The scarred inner lining of your eyelid continues to deform , causing your lashes to turn in so that they rub on and scratch the transparent outer surface of your eye ( cornea ) . Corneal clouding ( opacity ) . The cornea becomes affected by an inflammation that is most commonly seen under your upper lid . Continuous inflammation compounded by scratching from the in-turned lashes leads to clouding of the cornea . All the signs of trachoma are more severe in your upper lid than in your lower lid . Without intervention , a disease process that begins in childhood can continue to advance into adulthood .',\n",

       "  \"mansion and symptom of paraneoplastic syndromes of the nervous system can develop relatively quickly , often over days to weeks . Signs and symptoms of paraneoplastic syndromes of the nervous system often begin even before a cancer is diagnosed . Signs and symptoms vary depending on the body part being injured , and may include : Difficulty walking Difficulty maintaining balance Loss of muscle coordination Loss of muscle tone or weakness Loss of fine motor skills , such as picking up objects Difficulty swallowing Slurred speech or stuttering Memory loss and other thinking ( cognitive ) impairment Vision problems Sleep disturbances Seizures Hallucinations Unusual involuntary movements Types of paraneoplastic syndromes Examples of paraneoplastic syndromes of the nervous system include : Cerebellar degeneration ( cerebellar ataxia ) . This is the loss of nerve cells in the area of the brain that controls muscle functions and balance ( cerebellum ) . Signs and symptoms may include unsteady or impaired walking , lack of muscle coordination in your limbs , inability to maintain your trunk posture , dizziness , nausea , involuntary eye movement , double vision , difficulty speaking , or difficulty swallowing . Limbic encephalitis . This is inflammation affecting a region of the brain known as the limbic system , which controls emotions , behaviors and certain memory functions . People with this disorder may experience personality changes or mood disturbances , memory loss , seizures , hallucinations , or drowsiness . Encephalomyelitis . This syndrome refers to inflammation of the brain and spinal cord . There may be a wide variety of symptoms and signs depending on the area affected . Opsoclonus-myoclonus . This syndrome is due to dysfunction of the cerebellum or its connections . It can cause rapid , irregular eye movements ( opsoclonus ) and involuntary , chaotic muscle jerks ( myoclonus ) in your limbs and trunk . Stiff person syndrome . Previously called stiff man syndrome , this syndrome is characterized by progressive , severe muscle stiffness or rigidity , mainly affecting your spine and legs . It may also cause painful muscle spasms . Myelopathy . This term refers to a syndrome of injury limited to the spinal cord . Depending on the level of spinal cord injury , you may have changes in bowel and bladder function , and severe weakness and numbness up to a certain level in your body . If the level of injury includes your neck , you can have severe disability affecting all four limbs . Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome . This is a syndrome caused by disrupted communication between nerves and muscles . Signs and symptoms include pelvic and lower extremity muscle weakness , fatigue , difficulty swallowing , difficulty speaking , irregular eye movement , and double vision . Autonomic nervous system problems can include dry mouth and erectile dysfunction in males . When it occurs as a paraneoplastic syndrome , Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome is typically associated with lung cancer . Myasthenia gravis . Myasthenia gravis is also related to disrupted communication between nerves and muscles and also characterized by weakness and rapid fatigue of any of the muscles that are under voluntary control , including muscles in your face , eyes , arms and legs . The muscles involved in chewing , swallowing , talking and breathing may be affected as well . When myasthenia gravis occurs as a paraneoplastic syndrome , it is typically associated with cancer of the thymus gland ( thymoma ) . Neuromyotonia . Neuromyotonia — also known as Isaacs ' syndrome — is characterized by abnormal impulses in nerve cells outside the brain and spinal cord ( peripheral nerve hyperexcitability ) that control muscle movement . These impulses can cause twitching , muscle rippling that looks like a `` bag of worms , '' progressive stiffness , muscle cramps , slowed movement and other muscle impairments . Peripheral neuropathy . This condition refers to patterns of damage to nerves that transmit messages from the brain or spinal column to the rest of your body . When damage involves only the sensory nerves of the peripheral nervous system , you can have pain and disturbances in sensation anywhere in your body . Dysautonomia . Dysautonomia refers to a wide range of signs and symptoms resulting from injury to the nerves that regulate involuntary body functions ( autonomic nervous system ) , such as heart rate , blood pressure , sweating , and bowel and bladder functions . When this part of the nervous system is affected , common symptoms are low blood pressure , irregular heartbeats and trouble breathing .\",\n",

       "  \"babe with Rett syndrome ordinarily are born after an uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery . Most infants with Rett syndrome seem to grow and behave as expected for the first six months . After that , signs and symptoms start to appear . The most pronounced changes generally occur at 12 to 18 months of age , over a period of weeks or months . Symptoms and their severity vary greatly from child to child . The main signs and symptoms include : Slowed growth . Brain growth slows after birth . Smaller than usual head size ( microcephaly ) is sometimes the first sign that a child has Rett syndrome . As children get older , there is delayed growth in other parts of the body . Loss of movement and coordination abilities . The first signs often include reduced hand control and a decreasing ability to crawl or walk . At first , this loss of abilities occurs rapidly , and then it continues more gradually . Eventually muscles become weak or stiff , with unusual movement and positioning . Loss of communication abilities . Children with Rett syndrome typically begin to lose the ability to speak , to make eye contact and to communicate in other ways . They may become disinterested in other people , toys and their surroundings . Some children have rapid changes , such as a sudden loss of language . Over time , children may gradually regain eye contact and develop nonverbal communication skills . Unusual hand movements . Children with Rett syndrome usually develop repetitive , purposeless hand movements , which differ from child to child . Hand movements may include hand-wringing , squeezing , clapping , tapping or rubbing . Other signs and symptoms can include : Unusual eye movements . Children with Rett syndrome tend to have unusual eye movements , such as intense staring , blinking , crossed eyes or closing one eye at a time . Breathing problems . These include breath holding , rapid breathing ( hyperventilation ) , forcefully blowing out air or saliva , and swallowing air . These problems tend to occur during waking hours . Other breathing disturbances such as shallow breathing or short periods of stopping breathing ( apnea ) can occur during sleep . Irritability and crying . Children with Rett syndrome may become increasingly agitated and irritable as they get older . Periods of crying or screaming may begin suddenly , for no apparent reason , and last for hours . Some children may experience fears and anxiety . Other unusual behaviors . These may include , for example , sudden , odd facial expressions and long bouts of laughter , hand licking , and grasping of hair or clothing . Intellectual disabilities . Loss of skills may be connected to losing the ability to think , understand and learn . Seizures . Most people who have Rett syndrome experience seizures at some time during their lives . Multiple seizure types may occur and are associated with changes on an electroencephalogram ( EEG ) . Sideways curvature of the spine ( scoliosis ) . Scoliosis is common with Rett syndrome . It typically begins between 8 and 11 years of age and progresses with age . Surgery may be required if the curvature is severe . Irregular heartbeat . This is a life-threatening problem for many children and adults with Rett syndrome and can result in sudden death . Sleep disturbances . Problems with sleep patterns can include irregular sleep times , falling asleep during the day and being awake at night , or waking in the night with crying or screaming . Other symptoms .

Blood-clotting factors are substances in your blood that help stop bleeding . These abnormalities can lead to small blood clots forming more often than they normally would . In addition , people with calciphylaxis have an imbalance in the metabolism of calcium . This causes calcium to be deposited in the smallest parts of the arteries ( arterioles ) , which eventually leads to the formation of blood clots in the arterioles . Blood clots can cause fat tissues and skin to be deprived of oxygen and nourishment .\",\n",
